#Fibonacci Sequence Recursively

The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively. This project is an introduction to using recursive methods to solve problems.

This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
